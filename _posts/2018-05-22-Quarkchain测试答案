`D PoW`

12. Which one is correct?*  
A QuarkChain offers market driven collaborative mining.  
B QuarkChain supports cross-shard transactions.  
C QuarkChain has two layers, one is called rootchain.  
`D All above.`

13. Will QuarkChain support smart contact?*

B Ask a friend who has balance in shard B to do so.  
`C Have shard A directly access the smart contract.`  
D Go to exchange to buy some QKCs in shard B and perform the smart contract transaction.
